This directory containes the all the code necessary to generate events in IceCube 
with GENIE. In fact it is not detector specific, it just generates events in a 
cylindrical volume of H2O.

In order to run these programs, you will need to have GENIE version V2.6.0 installed. 
You can find instructions on how to do this at:

   http://projects.hepforge.org/genie/

GENIE is now also available through i3ports.

The environment variables set for this installation also need to be set accordingly 
(probably not necessary when installed through i3ports but not tested yet). 
For bash shell:

   export GENIE=/path/to/GENIE
   export ROOTSYS=/dpath/to/ROOT
   export PYTHIA6=/path/to/PYTHIA6
   export LHAPDF=/path/to/LHAPDF
   export LHAPATH=/path/to/LHAPDF/share/lhapdf
   export LOG4CPP=/path/to/log4cpp
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHIA6/lib:$LHAPDF/lib:$LOG4CPP/lib:$GENIE/lib
   export PATH=$PATH:$ROOTSYS/bin:$GENIE/bin:$LHAPDF/bin

On top of the env vars above, some scripts also rely the MYGENIE environment variable, which is 
simply the location of this directory. Also the location of the library containing 
the flux and geo drivers must be added LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

   export MYGENIE=/path/to/genie-generator 
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$MYGENIE/lib

(genie-generator is this implemetation of the IceCube environment in GENIE)

This directory contains the following subdirectories:

- GenieDriversIceCube: contains the iceube specific flux and geometry drivers.
  Type 'make' in this directory and the library will be build and put into the lib/ 
  subdirectory. 

- genie: has several programs:
  
     gICEVGen.cxx: generate events in a cylinder with random position and direction. 
                   It has many configurable parameters, se the beginning of this file
                   for more details. In orer to run this program you also need to 
                   download the cross section splines (see later)

     hepevt_writer.cxx: reads in the GENIE ntuples and writes them out into a file in
                        HEPEVT format

     eventloop.cxx: analysis of GENIE ntuple output files.

  Typing 'make' will produce an executable for each of these programs

- xsec_splines: empty directory to put in the xsection splines. They can be 
  downloaded from:

   http://w3.iihe.ac.be/~mdier/icecube/genie/xsec_splines/
  
   You only need to get the one called gxspl-water-v2.6.0.xml and the corresponding 
   gxspl-water-v2.6.0.root file.

- scripts: some examples

    gen_gicevgen.sh: example on how to run gicevgen

    plot_xsec.C: plot the cross sections from the root xsection file that can be 
                 produced using the gspl2root utility provided with GENIE

    Messenger.xml: output verbosity settings for GENIE

- root-geo: initial work to have ROOT Geometry description for IceCube

- pbs: utility scripts to submit jobs to the icecube computing cluster in Brussels
