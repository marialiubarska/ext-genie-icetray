This I3Module is a tool to read in gzipped files in HEPEVT format and converts the 
events into an MCTree with events containing I3Particles. In order to run it you will
need to add the lib directory to your PYTHONPATH:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/location/hepevt-reader/lib

for bash shells or the analogue for other shells.

In the scripts/ subdirectory are example python icetray scripts showing how to 
use it:

GENIE-p1.py: basically read in hepevt.gz file, apply mmc, option -3, and write
             out the physics frames

GENIE-p2.py: take the output from p1, apply hit-maker and write out the events

GENIE-p3.py: take output from p2, apply noise, pmt and dom simulator, and write 
             out events


run_all.sh: run all the 3 above scripts sequentially
